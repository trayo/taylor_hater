# Taylor Hater

Taylor Hater is a Taylor Swift soundboard used to tell the haters in your life that "haters gonna hate".

It was build using the [Mousetrap.js](https://craig.is/killing/mice) library to capture keyboard input and the [Ion.Sound](http://ionden.com/a/plugins/ion.sound/en.html) library to play sounds.

The HTML and CSS was written by hand, and no frameworks were used.
